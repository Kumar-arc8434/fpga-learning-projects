# ⚡ FPGA Learning Projects

A collection of FPGA projects while learning **Verilog** and **Intel Quartus**.  
This repository tracks my progress as I experiment with digital logic and gradually work toward building a simple 4-bit CPU.

---

## 🖥️ Projects So Far
- **Multiplexer → LEDs**  
- **Switches → LEDs**

---

## 🛠️ Planned Projects
- **4-bit CPU** (instruction decoding, registers, ALU, program counter, memory interface)
- More small logic design experiments (counters, state machines, etc.)

---

## 🔧 Tools & Setup
- **Hardware**: FPGA development board (e.g., Intel/Altera Cyclone series)  
- **Software**: [Intel Quartus Prime](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/overview.html)  
- **HDL**: Verilog

## 🚀 Goals
- Learn the basics of digital design on FPGA hardware  
- Gain practical experience with Verilog HDL  
- Explore computer architecture concepts through hands-on projects  
- Document progress and share reusable code snippets
